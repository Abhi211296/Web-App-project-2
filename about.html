            About Business Model
          </h1>
          <p><h3>Customer Segments</h3>
The Customer Segments Building Block defines the
different groups of people or organizations an
enterprise aims to reach and serve.
1. Customers comprise the heart of any business model.
2. Without (profitable) customers, no company can survive
for long.
3. In order to better satisfy customers, a company may
group them into distinct segments with common needs,
common behaviors, or other attributes.
4. A business model may define one or several large or
small Customer Segments.
            </p>
			
          <p class="dark">
            <b>Value Propositions:</b>
The Value Propositions Building Block describes the
bundle of products and services that create value for
a specific Customer Segment.
<b>1.</b> The Value Proposition is the reason why customers turn
to one company over another.
<b>2.</b> It solves a customer problem or satisfies a customer
need.
<b>3.</b> Each Value Proposition consists of a selected bundle of
products and/or services that caters to the requirements
of a specific Customer Segment.
<b>4.</b> The Value Proposition is an aggregation, or bundle, of
benefits that a company offers customers. Some Value
Propositions may be innovative and represent a new or
disruptive offer. Others may be similar to existing
market offers, but with added features and attributes.</p>

<p><b>Channels:</b>
The Channels Building Block describes how a
company communicates with and reaches its
Customer Segments to deliver a Value Proposition.
Communication, distribution, and sales Channels comprise
a company's interface with customers.
Channels are customer touch points that play an important
role in the customer experience. </p>

<p class="dark"> <b>Customer Relationships:</b>
The Customer Relationships Building Block
describes the types of relationships a company
establishes with specific Customer Segments.
A company should clarify the type of relationship it wants to
establish with each Customer Segment. Relationships can
range from personal to automated. </p>

<p><b>Revenue Streams:</b>
 
The Revenue Streams Building Block represents the
cash a company generates from each Customer
Segment (costs must be subtracted from revenues to
create earnings).
1. If customers comprise the heart of a business model,
Revenue Streams are its arteries.
2. A company must ask itself: For what value is each
Customer Segment truly willing to pay?
3. Successfully answering that question allows the firm to
generate one or more Revenue Streams from each
Customer Segment.</p>

<p class="dark"> <b>Key Resources:</b>

The Key Resources Building Block describes the
most important assets required to make a business
model work. Every business model requires Key
Resources.
These resources allow an enterprise to create and offer a
Value Proposition, reach markets, maintain relationships
with Customer Segments, and earn revenues. Different Key
Resources are needed depending on the type of business
model. A microchip manufacturer requires capital-intensive
production facilities, whereas a microchip designer focuses
more on human resources.
Key resources can be physical, financial, intellectual, or
human. Key resources can be owned or leased by the
company or acquired from key partners.</p>

            <h3><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Cost Structure</h3>
            <p>
The Cost Structure describes all costs incurred to
operate a business model
This building block describes the most important costs
incurred while operating under a particular business model.
Creating and delivering value, maintaining Customer
Relationships, and generating revenue all incur costs. Such
costs can be calculated relatively easily after defining Key
Resources, Key Activities, and Key Partnerships. Some
business models, though, are more cost-driven than others.
So-called “no frills” airlines, for instance, have built
business models entirely around low Cost Structures.</p>
